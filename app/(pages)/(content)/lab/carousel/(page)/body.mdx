I've recently had to implement an infinite carousel for a project, with some specific requirements: it had to handle a large number of items,
maintaining a consistent spacing between the items despite having different item sizes, and and above all, it had to be performant.

It was quite challenging to implement, and I came across some interesting problems, so I wanted to share my solution in case it helps others.

I built it primarily using <i>Motion (ex Framer Motion)</i> as the main animation library, coupled with <i>use-gesture</i> for handling drag and scroll interactions. While Motion provides these capabilities,
I found use-gesture to be more flexible and also more performant for this specific use case.

One of the key features of this implementation is that the carousel is <i>virtualized</i> - it only renders items that currently visible in the viewport (check out the <Link href="/lab/carousel/demo?debug" underline accentColor="purple" newWindow>debug mode</Link> for a visual demonstration).
This approach ensures that the carousel is performant even with a large number of items.

If you want to have a look at the code, check the files on <BaseLink href={contentMetadata.githubUrl}><IconTextAligner className="w-32"><IconTextAligner.Icon name="github" className="rotate-[8deg] hover:rotate-[-8deg] text-theme-icon-github" /></IconTextAligner></BaseLink>,  
or try it out on the demo below.
