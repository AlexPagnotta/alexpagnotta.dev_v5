Some time ago, I stumbled upon <Link href="https://usetrmnl.com/" underline accentColor="random">TRMNL</Link>, an e-ink tablet with the ability to display various dashboards, including weather data, Hacker News, calendar events, and more.

I immediately fell in love with the idea, and quickly reached to the "Buy now" button, but then I thought, I have an old kindle, a 3D printer, and some coding skills, maybe i can replicate the same concept with some DYI.

# The software

On the software side, I had a simple list of requirements:

- **Flexibility**: I wanted to be able to add any type of tool or feature, either now or in the future.
- **Interactive**: A lot of other solutions just display an image on the screen, refreshed after a certain interval of time, in my case I wanted to be able to interact with the software, using the kindle touch screen.
- **Simple**: One option would have been to develop a native kindle app, loaded though <Link href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326" underline accentColor="random">KUAL</Link>, but would be pretty limited in functionalities, and would have forced me to learn an entire new stack for it.

For all these reasons I decided to just build the dashboard as a simple website, specifically I used NextJS + Tailwind, and hosted it on vercel, the full source code is available <Link href="https://github.com/AlexPagnotta/kindle-dash" underline accentColor="random">here</Link>, if you are curious on how it works.

I didn't want to make it super complex for now, so I decided to start with a basic set of features:

- Date and time
- RSS Feed widget with custom sources
- Hacker news widet with top posts
- Notion integration, to show tasks and field from databases
- Screensaver, displays an image from Unsplash with dithering effect

We defined the tech stack, and the fetures we need, we now need a way to display this website on the device, the Kindle has an experimental native browser, but is pretty outdated and lack some of the features we would need, so I had to take a different route, the Linux route.
During my reasearch for this project, I came across the <Link href="https://github.com/schuhumi/alpine_kindle">Alpine Kindle project</Link>, a way to boot alpine linux directly in the kindle, this is the perfect solution for me, as it provides us with a full fledged and up to date browser where we can display the dashboard websit without any type of limitation.

That said, this is not the most straightforward process, installing Alpine Linux on kindle requires jailbreak, that is not available on the latest versions of KindleOS, and several plugins/applets to be installed and configured, the entire process is pretty long, but I've added some basic instructions on the <Link href="https://github.com/AlexPagnotta/kindle-dash?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions" underline accentColor="random">project repo</Link>.

# The UI

I'm not a designer, so coming up with a good looking UI for me is always a challenge, even more difficult this time since the Kindle screen has a gray-scale only screen, so no colors, and a limited amount of contrast options.
In the end I think I was able to come up with something simple but functional, I got some inspiration from the TRMNL project and <Link href="https://usetrmnl.com/framework" underline accentColor="random">their design system</Link>, with some adaptations to account for my use case.

# The Kindle

Nothing was really required on the hardware side of the Kindle, just a simple stand would be enough to have a nice lookng dashboard device on the desk, but as I said on the intro, I have a 3D printer, so why not use it to create a custom case for the occasion?
So after a couple of hours and the help of Autodesk Fusion, I came up with a simple custom case for the Kindle, stand included, to make it as slim as possible, I decided to actually replace the original Kindle case with mine, so I had to first disassemble the Kindle, removing the plastic shell, and then place the motherboard+screen plate on the new case.

# Final Result

It's now time for the big showcase (drum roll...)

This small side project was a really fun for me, as a software dev I am used to build products, but being able to work on something that combines both software and hardware was a completely different experencies, and more importantly, the end products is something that I ended up using daily, to check my tasks for the day, be updated to the latest news, or simply to check the weather.
