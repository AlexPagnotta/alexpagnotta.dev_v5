Some time ago, I stumbled upon <Link href="https://usetrmnl.com/" underline accentColor="random">TRMNL</Link>, an e-ink tablet that can display various dashboards, including weather data, Hacker News, calendar events, and more.

I immediately fell in love with the idea and quickly reached for the "Buy now" button, but then I thought, "I have an old Kindle, a 3D printer, and some coding skills, maybe I can replicate the same concept with some DIY magic.", and that's exactly what I did.

# The software

On the software side, I had a simple list of requirements:

- **Flexible**: I wanted to be able to add any type of tool or feature, either now or in the future.
- **Interactive**: Other solutions just render a static image on the kindle screen, refreshed after a certain interval of time. In my case, I wanted to be able to interact with the software using the Kindle's touch screen, so that approach would not work for me.
- **Simple**: One option would have been to develop a native Kindle app, loaded through <Link href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326" underline accentColor="random">KUAL</Link>, but it would be pretty limited in functionality and would have forced me to learn an entirely new stack.

For all these reasons, I decided to just build the dashboard as a simple website, using NextJS + Tailwind and hosted it on Vercel. The full source code is available <Link href="https://github.com/AlexPagnotta/kindle-dash" underline accentColor="random">here</Link> if you're curious about how it works.

I didn't want to make it super complex for now, so I decided to start with a basic set of features:

- Date and time
- RSS Feed widget with custom sources
- Hacker News widget showing the top posts
- Notion integration to show tasks and fields from databases
- Screensaver that displays an image from Unsplash with a nice dithering effect

Now that we've defined the tech stack and the features we need, we need a way to display this website on the device. The Kindle has an experimental native browser, but it's pretty outdated and lacks some of the features we would need, so I had to take a different route.

During my research for this project, I came across the <Link href="https://github.com/schuhumi/alpine_kindle">Alpine Kindle repo</Link>, a way to boot Alpine Linux directly on the Kindle. This is the perfect solution for me, as it provides us with a full-fledged and up-to-date browser where we can display the dashboard website without any limitations.

That said, this is not the most straightforward process, installing Alpine Linux on Kindle requires a jailbreak, which is not available on the latest versions of KindleOS, and several plugins/applets to be installed and configured. The entire process is pretty long, but I've added some basic instructions on the <Link href="https://github.com/AlexPagnotta/kindle-dash?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions" underline accentColor="random">project repo</Link>.

# The UI

I'm not a designer, so coming up with a good-looking UI is always a challenge for me. It was even more difficult this time since the Kindle screen has a grayscale-only display, so no colors and a limited amount of contrast options.

In the end, I think I was able to come up with something simple but functional. I got some inspiration from the TRMNL project and <Link href="https://usetrmnl.com/framework" underline accentColor="random">their design system</Link>, with some adaptations to account for my use case.

# The Kindle

Nothing was really required on the hardware side of the Kindle, just a simple stand would be enough to have a nice-looking dashboard device on the desk. But as I said in the intro, I have a 3D printer, so why not use it to create a custom case for the occasion?

So after a couple of hours and the help of Autodesk Fusion, I came up with a simple custom case for the Kindle, stand included. To make it as slim as possible, I decided to actually replace the original Kindle case with mine, so I had to first disassemble the Kindle, removing the plastic shell, and then place the motherboard + screen plate in the new case.

# Final Result

It's now time for the big showcase (drum roll... ü•Å)

This small side project was really fun for me, as a software dev, I'm used to building products, but being able to work on something that combines both software and hardware was a completely different experience.

More importantly, the end product is something that I ended up using daily to check my tasks for the day, stay updated with the latest news, or simply check the weather.
