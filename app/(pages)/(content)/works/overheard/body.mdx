What is Overheard? Well not easy to explain, I guess I can just use their own words:

<MarkdownBlockquote accentColor={contentMetadata.accentColor}>
  Every city talks, we listenâ€¦ A less creepy Alexa, if you will. We overhear what urbanites are talking about wherever
  they go. Whether it's the latest microdosing hype or full-volume sex recaps at the farmer's market, our public service
  is to curate and share this information with our community and make you laugh during your 10+ hours of daily screen
  time.
</MarkdownBlockquote>

To summarize, Overheard is an organization that is mostly active on social media. They share funny stories and news that are <i>overheard</i> on city streets and share them with their community members.

The goal of the project was to create a new website for their organization, representing the Overheard fun and quirky brand, and be able to attract potential sponsors and future employees.

The result is a website with retro vibes, characterized by the use of floating windows and vintage elements, but with a playful and colorful design given by a consistent list of interactive themes and animated gifs that spans throughout the entire experience.

You can find some highlights from the Overheard website below, but you can also visit the <Link underline accentColor="pink" href="https://overheardhq.com/">live site</Link> to see the full project.
