In 2022, we had the chance to work with Duolingo on a small microsite for the upcoming football world cup in Qatar.

The idea was to create a simple and fun way to help users learn how to cheer on or insult teams in other languages, and that resulted in a playful and heavily animated site with duolingo's mascot <DuoFloatingContent>Duo</DuoFloatingContent> alternating between chherful and angry based on the user's choice.

Do you also want to learn some new cheers or insults in other languages? Visit the <Link underline accentColor="green" href="https://fowllanguage.duolingo.com/">website</Link>, and have fun!
