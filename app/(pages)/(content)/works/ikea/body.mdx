As part of a new Ikea marketing campaign, called "Favoritos", we were commissioned to create a small microsite with a simple fun idea: Find the most popular and loved ikea products in each room of a virtual store and have the chance to win a trip for two to Sweden! 🇸🇪

Each room of the virtual store has been designed and rendered for the occasion, the user can look around the different rooms to find the products, both using standard controls, or with gyroscope controls on mobile devices.

The main challenge of this project was to provide a seamless experience for the user while exploring the store. This involved synchronizing the 360° environment images with the rendered 3d videos of the transitions between rooms, creating the <i>"illusion"</i> of continuous navigation within the 3D ambient.
