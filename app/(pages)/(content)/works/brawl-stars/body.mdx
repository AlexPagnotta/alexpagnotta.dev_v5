To celebrate Brawl Stars' fifth anniversary, together with <Link href="https://buck.co/work/supercell-brawl-stars-lore" underline accentColor="pink">Buck</Link>,
we created a dynamic and interactive experience, to explain and further explore the lore of the game.

As you may already know, if you are a Brawl Stars player, the game takes place in an abandoned amusement park called <StarrParkFloatingContent>Starr Park</StarrParkFloatingContent>,
and that's exactly where the story starts in our experience.

Via an hidden easter egg in the game, players are teleported to a mysterious security room from 1995.
Inside, they gradually discover the history of Starr Park through interactive element, including surveillance footage from 5 CCTV screens,
phone voicemails, a security guard's detailed logbook, and an old computer terminal.
All these elements will then lead to the events behind the park's abandonment and the origin stories of the game characters.

The 5 video footages went live 24 hours a day for 42 days, showing original videos entirely created by Buck.
In addition to that, all the accessory content, like the objects on the desk, the notes on the logbook, and the phone voicemails, were always different and regularly updated,
so that players could come up with new theories and speculations every day.

One of the most engaging features was the <i>Timecode</i> terminal input system,
Supercell would occasionally hide special code throughout the game and their social media posts, creating an exciting treasure hunt for players.
These codes would unlock exclusive preview access to highlight videos before their official release.
It was thrilling to check Twitter and Reddit as the community collaborated to crack the codes, some would try to find hints in the videos or come up with fanciful theories,
while others with less conventional methods, would just try to brute-force the system.

The project has been a great success, it received over <strong>89 million views</strong> and a lot of buzz on social media, with players discussing the recent events and coming up with new theories on what was going to happen next.

Unfortunately, the site is not accessible anymore, but you can still check out the experience and all the events that happened in the park, with this <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quP4mJDC2cE" underline accentColor="pink">summary video</Link> by Supercell.
